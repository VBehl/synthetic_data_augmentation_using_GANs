A computer vision pipeline for visual defect detection on the MVTec AD dataset using synthetic data generation via CycleGAN and classification via fine-tuned ResNet18.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project enhances defect detection using a combination of synthetic data generation and deep learning classification:

- **CycleGAN** learns to translate "good" images into realistic defect images.
- **ResNet18** is fine-tuned to classify images as "good" or "defect" using both real and synthetic images.
- Emphasis is placed on creating **balanced training and testing datasets** to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

## üß† Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Extracted and balanced real samples from MVTec AD categories (`bottle`, `cable`, etc.)
   - Created `trainA` (good images) and `trainB` (real defects) for CycleGAN training

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Trained **CycleGAN** using good ‚Üî defect samples
   - Generated realistic defect images from good samples to increase diversity

3. **ResNet18 Classification**
   - Used transfer learning (pretrained ResNet18)
   - Unfroze layers `layer3`, `layer4`, `fc` for fine-tuning
   - Trained using a mix of real + synthetic defect images

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Evaluated with metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, MCC**
   - Visualized with **ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Grad-CAM**, and training graphs
