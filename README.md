# QuickCycle: Rapid Defect Detection via CycleGAN Augmentation

## Overview
This project enhances defect detection using synthetic data generated by a pre-trained CycleGAN. It uses the MVTec AD dataset and trains a lightweight CNN classifier.

## Folder Structure
- data/: raw, processed, and synthetic images
- models/: CycleGAN and CNN model files
- src/: all Python scripts
- experiments/: logs and results
- paper/: research paper and figures

## Setup
1. Create the Anaconda environment (defect_detection_env)
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start with data preprocessing using scripts in src/
